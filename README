Storage Galaxy (stolaxy)

INTRODUCTION

stolaxy is an attempt to put together a quick storage appliance with
the following capabilities.

1. NFS Server/iSCSI
2. Distributed datastore (replicated)
3. Tiering
4. Deduplication
5. Compression
6. Snapshots

Whereever possible we will use python to provide an
implementation. This may hamper performance and where we feel
performance to be unacceptable to continue we will attempt to provide
a better implementation using C. Note: The goal of this project is not
to provide a blazingly fast storage service but a platform for blazing
fast prototyping.

HOW TO USE THIS PROJECT

1. checkout from git https://github.com/muralinagaraj/stolaxy.git and
make. This will take care of building all the components. If you would
rather use the virtual appliance instead contact us.

There are a few dependencies which are loosely listed below in the
dependencies section, please ensure the development environment is
setup.

2. To start the stolaxy service manually go to the server directory
and issue the following command

# python stolaxy.py 
stolaxy.py --address=<ipaddress> --serverid=<serverid> --name=<clustername>

WARNING: this is under development and the way the stolaxy instance is
started is likely to change.

--address is the ipaddress of the interface used for clustering,
  --serverid is a unique numeric server identifier e.g 1, and --name
  --is the name of the clsuter - this has to be the same on all the
  --nodes for peer nodes to join the cluster.


e.g. suppose you want to start a 3 node replicated shared nothing nfs
server you can do this as follows

node1 # python stolaxy.py --address=192.168.56.1 --serverid=1 --name=mycluster
node2 # python stolaxy.py --address=192.168.56.2 --serverid=2 --name=mycluster
node3 # python stolaxy.py --address=192.168.56.3 --serverid=3 --name=mycluster
