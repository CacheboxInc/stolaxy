Storage Galaxy (stolaxy)

INTRODUCTION

stolaxy is an attempt to put together a quick storage appliance with
the following capabilities.

1. NFS Server
2. Distributed datastore (replicated)
3. Tiering
4. Deduplication
5. Compression
6. Snapshots

Whereever possible we will use python to provide an
implementation. This may hamper performance and where we feel
performance to be unacceptable to continue we will attempt to provide
a better implementation using C. Note: The goal of this project is not
to provide a blazingly fast storage service but a platform for blazing
fast prototyping.

HOW TO USE THIS PROJECT

1. NFS Server: the nfs server can be started as follows: 

python pynfs/nfs4.0/nfs4server.py
