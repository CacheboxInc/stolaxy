Storage Galaxy (stolaxy)

INTRODUCTION

stolaxy is an attempt to put together a quick storage appliance with
the following capabilities.

1. NFS Server
2. Distributed datastore (replicated)
3. Tiering
4. Deduplication
5. Compression
6. Snapshots

Whereever possible we will use python to provide an
implementation. This may hamper performance and where we feel
performance to be unacceptable to continue we will attempt to provide
a better implementation using C. Note: The goal of this project is not
to provide a blazingly fast storage service but a platform for blazing
fast prototyping.

HOW TO USE THIS PROJECT

1. NFS Server: the nfs server can be started as follows: 

set the path to the rsm directory and concoord distribution in the
PYTHONPATH before starting the nfs server.

export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/src/sandbox/stolaxy/rsm/:~/src/sandbox/stolaxy/concoord-1.1.0/
python pynfs/nfs4.0/nfs4server.py -a 192.168.2.45 -p 14000 -o nfshandle.NFSHandle --export=/tmp/

-a = the IP address of the localhost
-p = use 14000 for now.
--export = specify the folder you want to export via nfs
-o nfshandle.NFSHandle

this is on the first node, the remaining nodes should pass a -b
<IPADDRESS:14000> of the master node from where to bootstrap. this is
ugly for now but needs to be fixed.
