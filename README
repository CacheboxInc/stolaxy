Storage Galaxy (stolaxy)

It is an attempt to put together a quick storage appliance with the
following capabilities.

1. NFS Server
2. Distributed datastore
3. Tiering
4. Deduplication
5. Compression

Whereever possible we will use python to provide an
implementation. This may hamper performance and wherever we feel the
performance is unacceptable to continue we will attempt to provide a
better implementation using C. Note: The goal of this project is not
to provide a blazingly fast storage service but a platform for blazing
fast prototyping.
